# awesome-firstparty-linux
A collection of first-party Linux desktop applications. Linux should be a first-class citizen among non-developers, and companies should develop first-party Linux applications the same as they do for Windows and OS X. This repository is meant to be a collection of first-party applications for Linux, with links to installation instructions. These should be applications that those coming to Linux from other OS's will be familiar with.

Pull requests are very welcome!
