# Linux for normal people
A collection of first-party Linux desktop applications. Linux should be a first-class citizen among non-developers, and companies should develop first-party Linux applications the same as they do for Windows and OS X. This repository is meant to be a collection of first-party applications for Linux, with links to installation instructions. These should be applications that those coming to Linux from other OS's will be familiar with. My hope is that this can be a resource for those helping family and friends switch to Linux and retain the applications they know.

Pull requests are very welcome!
